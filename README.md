# GrowTwitter (back-end)

</div>

## What is this? :thinking: 

GrowTwitter is a fictitious social network created by [Growdev](https://www.growdev.com.br/) with a style similar to Twitter. The purpose of this tool is to allow users to interact with each other through various functionalities. In this project, the back-end of GrowTwitter was developed using the TypeScript language and object-oriented programming principles. Each user creates an account and, with that, can send tweets, follow other users, like tweets from others, and even reply to them with their own responses

## Why did you build this :question: :question: :question:

At the moment (2024) I'm studying at [Growdev](https://www.growdev.com.br/) in their fullstack web developer course and I'm currently in Object Orientation module (In this module we learn about TypeScript, Programming
Object Oriented and its pillars). And, as the last challenge of this module, we were asked to create this!
